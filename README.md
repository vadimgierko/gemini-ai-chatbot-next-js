## Gemini AI Chatbot Features

### 🚀 Google Sign In
Sign in using Google Account to use the app for free. This is needed to prevent abusing app API routes by malicious users.

### 💬 Text-based Temporary Chat Streaming
Your chat is temporary, so it's not stored in the database. AI provides streaming responses to deliver content as soon as possible.

### 🎯 System Instruction (Context)
Provide system instruction, also known as context, to get more tailored responses.

### 📝 Markdown Support
Gemini AI responses use Markdown syntax, so the app implements a Markdown renderer to style the responses.
