## Motivation

I created this app as an open-source showcase of my current full-stack development skills while also aiming to help other developers.

Additionally, I wanted to explore the fundamental capabilities and features of the Gemini API.

I have many ideas for future enhancements and plan to add new features gradually. However, updates will be made only occasionally, as this project serves as a side diversion from my main private project, which will be published soon.
